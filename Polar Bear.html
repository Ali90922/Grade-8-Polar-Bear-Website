<h2 style ="color:White;">Diet and Hunting</h2>
<p> The artic is home to millions of selas and becuase of this the Polar bears prey on seals very frequently so seals are a frequent part of a Polar Bears diet.The polar bears hunt for seals in water they rarely catch any seals on land.The polar bears most common method of hunting on ground is called still huting in which the bear uses it's excellent sense of smell to locate a seal. Although polar bears are very powerful they always hunt predetors smaller then themselves.In canada a studies showed that all polar bears living in canada had fed on seaweed {Marine algae}<p>

<div id = "Physical characteristics">
<h2 style ="color:White;"> Physical characteristics</h2>
<p> The polar bear is one of the worlds largest bears and is only surpassed by the <b>Kodiak Bear</b> which is a subspeicies of the brown bear.Adult Polar bears weight 350 kilograms to 700 kilograms and they measure in lenght in average 2.3 meters. Female polar bears are half the size of the male polar bears.Female polar bears weight around roughly 150 - 250 Kilograms and they measre 1.8 meters in lenght roughly.The feet of the polar bear are very wide to reduce pressure on ice when walking on ice so the ice does not break apart an average foot measures 12 inches across.Compared with it's closest relative the <b>Brown bear</b> has a longer skull and a a longer nose</p>

<h2 style ="color:White;">Life expactency</h2>
<p>Polar bears rarely live beyond 25 years.[128] The oldest wild bears on record died at age 32, whereas the oldest captive was a female who died in 1991, age 43.[129] The causes of death in wild adult polar bears are poorly understood, as carcasses are rarely found in the species's frigid habitat.[126] In the wild, old polar bears eventually become too weak to catch food, and gradually starve to death. Polar bears injured in fights or accidents may either die from their injuries or become unable to hunt effectively, leading to starvation.[126]</p>

<div id ="Climate Change">
<h2 style="color:White;">Climate Change</h2>
<p>
In the recent years the Polar bears have faced a very significant threat becuase of climate change. Many people are speculating that Climate change will lead the Polar bears to extinction. Biologists also a lot of speculation on the follwing subject as they believe that the cimate change will lead the Polar bears to change there adaptations which will over time let the polar bear evolve into another kind of bear which is not adapted to the cold Artic climate.Climate change is also making it very difficult for the polar Bears to Travel,to raise there young and to hunt.It is estimated that Polar bears will go extinct in next 20-40 Years.
